Write-Up:

1. open terminal
2. Input "ssh -h" to see the commands available:

unknown option - h
usage: ssh [-1246AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec]
           [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char]
           [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
           [-J [user@]host[:port]] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
           [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port] [-Q query_option] [-R address]
           [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
           [user@]hostname [command]

While there is no help defined, the shell was nice to still give us all available parameters back.
Now we use the username and we try the syntax defined as [user@]hostname

3. Input "ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" gives the following answer:

The authenticity of host 'bandit0bandit.labs.overthewire.org (178.79.134.250)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Hlh5ZcIKRiQ3pRRjBT2Z873ALJtRx6XragCg3suK4nU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Seems like we got a connection, but we don't know if the system is realy the system we wanted to connect to.
In this case I'm going to trust it and contiune by inputing yes.

4. Input "yes" and wait for server answer:

This is the OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

Please note that wargame usernames are no longer level<X>, but wargamename<X>
e.g. vortex4, semtex2, ...

Note: at this moment, blacksun is not available.

ganbaruTobi@bandit0bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:

Here we have to input the password from the description.

5. Input "bandit0" and we are in:

Welcome to the OverTheWire games machine!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven on
irc.overthewire.org.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine holds several wargames. 
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
  so that users can not snoop on eachother.

  Please play nice:
      
    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS! 
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro 

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /usr/local/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /usr/local/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) in /usr/src/pwntools/
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/) should be in $PATH

Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH to log into that level and continue the game.

Commands you may need to solve this level:
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

6. Input "ls" to list directorys content:

readme

So there is one file called readme, we can see its content with cat

7. Input "cat readme" shows the pw:

With this password we can login as bandit1 in the next level.
