1. Connect "ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
2. Enter password we got from lvl0
3. Input "ls" gives:

-

Thats probably what the file is called.

4. Input "cat -" does:



Nothing... it waits for input. When we write bla, bla gets returnd in the shell. Seems like - is some kind of special character here.
Using the first link gives a lot of results on how to solve this. we can escape - by writing '-' or "-"

5. Input "cat '-'" gives:

Nothing... this workaround doesnt help. The problem is cat sees - as a synonym for stdin
So we use a relative path to make it understand its not stdin

6. Input "cat ./-" returns:
